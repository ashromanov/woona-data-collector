# Recording data

Android and iOS use the same V2 questionnaires. Questions, options and validation
live in Git; the server owns accepted answers, profile versions and revisions.
A recording references one dog UUID and its accepted profile-version UUID.
Names and filenames do not establish identity. Later profile edits create a new
version; unchanged answers reuse the existing version.

Every recording retains packet, packet timeline, raw fragments, diagnostics,
sync metadata and all recorded video. Failed validation/upload preserves the
whole local unit and reports the error. Training performs any packet filtering
or cropping; ingestion and export preserve source bytes.

`recording_sync` holds the native sensor/camera clock anchors. Its server-owned
`alignment` JSON holds hash-bound alignment evidence and BLE quality diagnostics.
`original_capture_sync` and `recovery` retain needed historical capture metadata.
An arrival timestamp alone does not establish a one-second error bound.

Label Studio uses `woona:<recording UUID>` and the same server questionnaires.
`python -m server.export_dataset OUTPUT --mode video` exports labeled intervals
in video seconds. `--mode ble` also requires measured alignment with at most one
second error, bound to exact packet/timeline/video SHA-256. It emits the time
mapping and sensor intervals without changing any source file. Export schema 2
preserves every original annotation range; `sensor_intervals` may split at video
pauses and omits only intervals with no certified mapping. All source files
remain complete. Accepted server metadata takes precedence over the original
capture sync artifact.

Retired identities are stored only as SHA-256 of lowercase UUID strings.
Authenticated `/v1/deletions` propagates deletion to clients and prevents upload
of the retired dog, profile, recording or artifact.
